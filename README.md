# DC_Motor_control_using_PWM

I recently worked on a project using the STM32F407 to control two DC motors with the L298N motor driver.
## Speed Control using PWM
## Direction Control with GPIO
## Motor Selection for independent control

The L298N is a great choice for motor control because:
Dual H-Bridge – Controls two DC motors independently.
Supports up to 35V – Works with a wide range of motors.
Handles up to 2A per channel – Suitable for medium-power applications.
PWM Compatible – Enables smooth speed control.
Simple GPIO Logic – Easy to set motor direction.
Built-in Protection – Prevents overheating & overcurrent issues.

## By using STM32 timers for PWM and GPIO control, I achieved smooth and precise motor movement. This project is a great way to explore embedded systems, motor control, and STM32 programming.
